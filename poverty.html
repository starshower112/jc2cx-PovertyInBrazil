        Poverty is a multifaceted issue facing Brazil. Our team has taken a multilayer view at researching the issues causing such impoverished conditions facing Brazilians today. Our main categories are income disparity, lack of jobs, water and sanitation, lack of infrastructure, and hunger. This portion is mostly going to be focused on income disparity, lack of jobs, and the effects of the pandemic welfare.

        Over the last decade poverty has been on the slightly variable. That is those living on less material means than what they need to live healthily. However, the changes have been quite minute in the overall change in material conditions in those living at or under the poverty line. There is another website that has been tracking the fluctuation in the changes. Mactrotrends.net<a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> identified the data as:

        In the years, 2016 – 2017, there was over a percent increase in the number of people facing poverty. However, from 2018-2019 there was less of a percent decrease, so poverty in effect over those four years grew over the rate in 2015. In recent years with the covid-19 pandemic, the government has made steps towards alleviating the symptoms in the form of monetary aid, however, it was not sufficient for many and didn’t even reach the one that most needed the aid the most. The new internationalist reported that the government issued four installments of around US $28, and that around 46 million Brazilian don’t have bank accounts to receive those installments<a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> (Milhorance, 2021).  Meaning a large portion of the population that were to receive the assistance didn’t get it and were likely the ones that needed it most.

        While covid-19 measure were inadequate, people found their jobs were evaporating as well. Unsafe working conditions drastically reduced the number of jobs available to the working class. Along with jobs being hard to find, there was a growing disparity between the wealthy and the working class. Among the working class, women are not compensated as well as men. The Borgen Project reported, “If the labor market were to continue his path as it has for the last twenty years, women and men won’t be earning the same wage until the year 2047, with 2086 being the year where the income of blacks and whites stands equal”<a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a> (Borgen, 2020). This represents a wide gap among working class individuals as well as the wealthy. All of these issues compound to throw millions into inadequate conditions. Habitat for humanity found, “…that more than 50 million Brazilians live in inadequate conditions. Most of these families have an income below the minimum wage of roughly US $300 per month”<a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a>. It is hard to imagine that many people without food, shelter and access to clean water.

        It is apparent that measures need to be taken to stim the tide of job loss and increase the rights of workers. Gaps need to be closed so that those are working are making equal wages for the same job, and that workers are being fairly compensated for their work and not loosing their labor. A government stimulus can be helpful, but steps need to be taken so that it can reach those in the most need as well as those with bank accounts. Perhaps community centers can be set up at local financial institutions or post offices allowing the distribution of aid.
